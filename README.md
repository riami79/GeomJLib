Java Geometric Function Library (GeomJLib) is a Java 8.0 library developed by Mirko Riazzoli and released under the license GPL Version 3.0.

GeomJLib provides functions for computing the main geometric quantities of 2D and 3D shapes (e.g. perimeters, apothems, areas, volumes) .

The file GeomJLibV1.0 contains the API of whole library, its documentation being provided by the similarly named pdf file.

The file Code2DV1.0 contains version 1.0 of the Java code for 2-D shapes.

The file Code3DV1.0 contains version 1.0 of the Java code for 3-D shapes.

To import in your program the library for 2-D shapes use: import GeometricJ.*;

To import in your program the library for 3-D shapes use: import GeometricJ3D.*;
